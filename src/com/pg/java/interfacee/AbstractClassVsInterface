Abstract Class and Interface with default methods are different.

Interface with default methods != Abstract class;

* In Abstract class we can declare  instance variable but we can't in interface bcoz
  all variables in interface are public static final by default.


* Abstract class can declare constructors to initialize instance variable but in interface
  we cannot declare constructors.
  
* Interface never talks about state of the object but abstract class may talk about 
  the state of the object in some case as it contains instance variables.
  
* We can declare static(for initialization purpose) and instance blocks in abstract class  but in
  interface we cannot declare static blocks and instance methods as it contains default,static
  and abstract methods.
  
* Interface can override object class methods but can't provide implementations for them as
  default methods but abstract class can override object class methods and provide the 
  required implementations for them.
